# Bettergram

An Instagram Clone application that contains some of the features that the real instagram has. Some of these features are likes,comments,profiles and others.

##### This is a Remake of a previous project this time leveraging TypeScript, making use of acutal queries instead of an ORM and implementing my own styling instead of using bootstrap
