# Bettergram
This is a Remake of a previous project to leverage TypeScript, make use of acutal queries instead of an orm structure and practice my own style instead of using bootstrap

An Instagram Clone application that contains some of the features that the real instagram has. Some of these features are likes,comments,profiles and others.

#### Note
- This was created for further developing my skills, and is not meant as an ofense to the existing app

- The code is not as clean as it can be since I first started this 2 years ago when I barely coded
